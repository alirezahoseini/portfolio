Writing code, solving problems, and finding solutions are really exciting to me. Also, working with an active team, where everyone works towards the same goal, is something I really enjoy.<br /> Over time, I’ve focused more on React, Next.js, and TypeScript. I started by building simple pages with HTML and CSS, and slowly moved into professional web development. Now, I work on projects that challenge me and help me learn new things.<br /> I’m always looking to grow and learn more. If you have an idea you want to turn into a professional website, I’d love to chat!",
